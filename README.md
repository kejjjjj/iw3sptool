## Notes
- Only for cod4 singleplayer patch 1.5

## Usage
- The .asi file goes to the "miles" folder located in the cod4 root directory
- All commands start with the cm_ prefix (clip map)
- cm_showCollisionFilter expects the name of a material (e.g. "clip") and using it without an argument will clear the render queue
- cm_showEntities expects the name of a classname (e.g. "trigger_multiple") and using it without an argument will clear the render queue
- using the "all" argument on cm_showCollisionFilter and cm_showEntities will select *ALL* relevant items 
- brushes are highlighted with green
- terrain brushmodels are highlighted with purple
- terrain is highlighted with blue
- entities are highlighted with orange
- spawners are highlighted with red
